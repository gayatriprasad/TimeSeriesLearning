# TimeSeriesLearning
Practise for my time seriess experiments

1) For the first experiment I used only London Energy Dataset and XGBoost. The features have been extracted from the given dataset.

2) For the second experiment, I have added London Weather Dataset in addition to the Energy Dataset. This gave more features to work with and the model still was XGBoost ( LightBGM was causing issues with memory )
